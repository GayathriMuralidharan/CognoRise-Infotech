# CognoRise Infotech Projects

Welcome to the CognoRise Infotech internship projects repository. This repository contains the data analysis projects I completed as part of the internship program.

## Projects Overview

### 1. 80 Cereals
- **Description**: An analysis of the nutritional content of 80 different cereals to determine their health ratings. This project aims to identify trends and provide insights for healthier consumer choices.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Files**: 
  - `80_cereals_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
  - `cereal_data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.

### 2. Red Wine Quality
- **Description**: A machine learning project that evaluates factors affecting the quality of red wine. The project involves predicting wine quality based on various features.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Files**: 
  - `red_wine_quality.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and model implementation.
  - `winequality-red.csv`: Dataset used for model training and analysis.

### 3. Unemployment in India
- **Description**: A data analysis project focused on unemployment trends in India. The project explores historical data to uncover patterns and suggests potential solutions for reducing unemployment.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Files**: 
  - `unemployment_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and analysis.
  - `unemployment_data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository and open the respective Jupyter notebooks.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CognoRise-Infotech.git
cd CognoRise-Infotech
```

## Installation

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for Red Wine Quality project)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook for the project you want to explore.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and results.
